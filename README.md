## Deprecated: Please use my [new tool!](https://github.com/GarnetSunset/rgg_save_tool_py)

Tools for encrypting/decrypting Yakuza/Judgment saves.

Original decryption code from [here](https://gist.github.com/simontime/59661a189b20fc3517b20d8c9f329017) by simontime. I
added proper checksum calculation and split the tool into two executables for easier usage.
